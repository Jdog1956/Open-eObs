- Patient Report
- Patient Visit Management (via `nh_eobs_adt_gui` module)
- Staff Allocation to Patients

It provides additional ward management tools for Mental Health settings:
- Patient Monitoring Exceptions (Patient off ward)

It provides the following tools to aid in the analysis of clinical activities:
- Overdue tasks list

## Installation
Open-eObs is a set of [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) modules that allow for electronic observations 
and builds on the [NHClinical](https://github.com/openeobs/nhclinical) set of modules.

We currently develop against [our own tag of Odoo](https://github.com/openeobs/odoo/tree/liveobs_1.11.1), this is to ensure consistency so it's recommended when
installing Odoo that you install this version.

Once you've downloaded Odoo, installed it's dependencies and installed PostgreSQL 9.3
you need to update the `server.cfg` file of your Odoo installation to point to 
the NhClinical and Open-eObs directories.

After restarting the server you can then log in as the admin user and install the
`nh_eobs_mobile` or `nh_eobs_mental_health` modules. These install the Acute and
Mental Health configurations of Open-eObs.

Additional modules such as `nh_eobs_adt_gui` and `nh_eobs_analysis` can also be
installed at this stage.

## Upgrading
To upgrade the Open-eObs modules you just need to update the Open-eObs modules and
press the upgrade module button for `nh_eobs_mobile` or `nh_eobs_mental_health` 
depending on what you have installed.

It's recommended you backup the existing database and module files before upgrading
so you can restore should anything go wrong.
